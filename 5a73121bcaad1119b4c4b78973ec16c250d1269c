A blueprint that uses this plugin must import the Cloudify types.  Doing it this way means that there will be no conflict between the imports in the blueprint and the import in the type file.",

      "message": "False is the right default.  (The idea is that the \"tls_info\" property is optional in a blueprint, but if it\u0027s present, it should have both \"use_tls\" and \"cert_directory\".  The Cloudify type definition system doesn\u0027t have a way to express that.  If it did, we wouldn\u0027t need defaulting.)   The \"use_tls\" name is now perhaps a bit misleading.  If it\u0027s set to true, it means that the component is acting as a TLS server and needs the full set of certificates provided by our tls initContainer.  If \"use_tls\" is false, the component just needs the CA cert, and we don\u0027t need the initContainer.",
