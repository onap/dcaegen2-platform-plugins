      "message": "I am not sure what the desired behavior is.  I have not been involved in the detailed discussions about this.  I thought originally CLAMP wanted to added a property to the policy node.  Alex Shatov suggested doing this by creating a new type, derived from dcae.policy.nodes, that simply added the field.   This can be done with a type file (or even with a type definition inside the blueprints).\n\nI pointed out that if we were not able to get a satisfactory resolution of DCAEGEN2-989 (related to type files being available in an environment without Internet connectivity), it would be necessary to package a new type file in some kind of a dummy plugin.  We did resolve DCAEGEN2-989, so all we need to solve the original problem as I understand it is a simple type file.   But I was not involved in the detailed discussions, so I may not understand the problem correctly.",
