      "message": "I understand that there are naming constraints on K8s but as a warning we ran into a lot of headaches doing this sort of name manipulations specifically replacing underbars to dash.  This I believe was only on the onboarding side.  I can\u0027t think of any potential pain points downstream of the deployment as long as the component reads its name from the SERVICE_NAME or HOSTNAME environment variables.  So this is just a warning from experience.",
