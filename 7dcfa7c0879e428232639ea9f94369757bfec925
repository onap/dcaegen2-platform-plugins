And aren\u0027t there other lines of code that would have a similar problem?\nThe change you\u0027re making here looks more like a change to allow for the \u0027mode\u0027 value to be absent from v[\u0027container\u0027].\n\nI don\u0027t have an issue with the change, but I don\u0027t understand the explanation.",
