      "message": "just for fun.. this function isn\u0027t tail recursive. Not that that matters for Python, but it helps writing stuff tail recursively for when you are in a lang that makes use of it.\n\nwith that said, after a few minutes, the transformation of this wasn\u0027t obvious. the killer is that in a deeply nested dict each stack frame has to stick around to wait for the  r\u003dupdate_dict call to resolve. \n\ni think it would have to be some kind of update_dict(d, u, current_stack) or something and instead of the loop push the vs onto the stack and return a call as the last operation.",
