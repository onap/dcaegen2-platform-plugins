      "message": "Is there a use case where the existence of tls_info is not enough to indicate that tls should be used?  I\u0027m wondering why a user would have a tls_info object with use_tls equal to False.  Benefit of removing the need for use_tls is that it\u0027ll simplify logic in the plugin.",
