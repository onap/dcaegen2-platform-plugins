      "message": "is there a cloudify specific reason you are making this change? This is far less pythonic. Especially if plugins can ever be pipped. Unless there is a cloudify specific reason to move from install_requires to requirements, I do not agree with this change as it is an anti pattern. With the possibly exception of the kubernetes\u003d\u003d9.0.0 since install_Requires isn\u0027t really the place for exact dependencies, so that should not have been like that to begin with probably.",
