      "message": "Looks to me that you will attempt to do a clean up automatically upon an exception.  This is a different approach from the docker plugin (and possibly the cdap plugin) where failures were simply reported.  The idea was to give operators the opportunity to investigate.  Clean up was a manual second step.  Should we change our approach?",

      "message": "I think the difference is that the Docker plugin essentially attempted to create and deploy one thing--a container.  k8sclient creates multiple k8s entries (none of which are known to the caller) as part of the deploy operation. The caller is not aware of the different k8s entities deployed by k8sclient, so it would not know how to do a cleanup.",

An alt approach is to do a lazy evaluation by invoking getter type functions when configuration parameters are needed.  Not a blocker because I see that you have the \"mockconfig\" fixture.",
